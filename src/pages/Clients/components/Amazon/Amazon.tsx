        Amazon is an American multinational technology company engaged in e-commerce, cloud computing, 
        online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. Founded in 1994 by Jeff 
        Bezos in Bellevue, Washington, the company originally started as an online marketplace for
         books but gradually expanded its offerings to include a wide range of product categories, 
         referred to as "The Everything Store". Today, Amazon is considered one of the Big Five 
         American technology companies, the other four being Alphabet, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.
